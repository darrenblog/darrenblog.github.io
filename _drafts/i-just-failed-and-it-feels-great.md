title: I just failed and it feels great
---


This week my colleagues and I closed down our Personal Financial Management startup, financial.me.

It was nearly 3 years in the making, and we poured a lot of energy into it. Feels like I should be feeling sad right now. But I feel awesome.&nbsp;

I think a large part of it is relief. We stopped actively working on financial.me a year ago, to go out & earn some contracting dollars. We hoped to repay the loan that had financed the development, and then get back to it. But after a year's solid contracting work, we looked at financial.me - and it just seemed a loooong way away from becoming a viable business. And a personal finance tool is not something you can just abandon - partly because users deserve support, and partly from the security angle.&nbsp;

I'm 43 years old, and I've been developing software fulltime for over 20 years.&nbsp;
