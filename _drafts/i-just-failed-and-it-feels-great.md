title: I just failed and it feels great
---


This week my [BitRocket](http://www.bitrocket.co.nz)&nbsp;colleagues and I closed down our Personal Financial Management startup, financial.me.

It was nearly 3 years in the making, and we poured a lot of energy into it. Feels like I should be feeling sad right now. But I feel awesome.&nbsp;

Some background: &nbsp;we stopped actively working on financial.me a year ago, to go out & earn some contracting dollars. We hoped to repay the loan that had financed the development, and then get back to it. But after a year's solid contracting work, we looked at financial.me - and it just seemed a loooong way away from becoming a viable business. And a personal finance tool is not something you can just abandon - partly because users deserve support, and partly from the security angle.&nbsp;

We humans build up a mental picture of who we are, and it's often closely related to our work or careers. In the first year or so of financial.me, my mental picture was: "I'm that guy working on a cool new startup"!
<br>Then in the second year it was "I'm that guy whose startup doesn't have many users yet but we'll get there!" Then it became "I'm that guy whose startup that is great technically but in trouble business-wise". And when I'm meeting people and telling them what I do, there's a little voice at the back of my head telling me I can see pity in their eyes - this guy is headed for disaster.

My contribution towards our contracting earnings over the last year has been working for for a small startup in the bike-fit space - [velogicfit](www.velogicfit.com). (I must confess I didn't even know that bike fit existed until I met these guys!). That has been the most interesting work I've had in my 20+ year software development career. We've done websites, web apps, and a WPF application that uses the Microsoft Kinect to do realtime image processing. We've built a system that can replace a $20k hardware rig with just a laptop and a Kinect. Technically it has been super interesting, but possibly more importantly, I haven't had to worry about the "business" side of the business - what to build or how to sell it.

Having now announced that we're closing down financial.me, my mental picture of myself shifts again. The future is now open for me again. I'm now "that guy building amazing Kinect apps".

I think there's a tendency amongst developers to believe that we can do anything. Building software is hard, and if we can do that, building a business must be easy, right? To some extent, yes, anything can be learned, and anybody with sufficient drive can build a business. But the key lesson for me in our startup is that yes you can do anything - but you can't do everything. Every day you spend learning about marketing, or working on business development, is a day you're not coding. And where do you think you add the most value as a software developer?

I'm hopeful that the next few years are spent working on this bike-fit gig. There are plenty of new interesting products that the Product Manager there is dreaming up for us to build. But if that does come to an end - I'll be looking for another similar contract. Something where I can just be an awesome developer, and someone else can stress out about the business side.&nbsp;

At least until my next harebrained startup idea.
