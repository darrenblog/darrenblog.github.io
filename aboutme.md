I'm a full-stack software developer based near Tauranga, New Zealand.

Here's a backwards version of the interesting bits of my career so far.

#### 2013-2014: working on a startup personal finance app, financial.me
This ended up being a fail - we closed it in April 2016. Lots of lessons learned along the way (TODO blog post!)
The important thing is that BitRocket survived, and we're all working on interesting and fulfilling contracting projects.

#### 2013: Started BitRocket!
After coming back from France, met up with my old colleagues Chris and Shannon, and we decided to put up a shingle and start our own software company, BitRocket.
Our first order of business: decide whether to go contracting, or try our hand at a start-up. We decided to take my embryonic PFM web app and turn it into a real product, financial.me

#### 2012-2013: took a year out for a family house-swap to France. 
Wow what an experience. On the work side, I treated this as an "engineering year" and worked on the PFM web app that would become
